  * Annotate a symbol (i.e. class, method, parameter, etc.) with `@positioned(positioned.here)` to retain source
  * position information for that symbol to be available in macro implementations which inspect that symbol.
  * This is necessary e.g. for determining declaration order of subtypes of sealed hierarchies in macro implementations.
  * This annotation is only needed when macro is invoked in a different source file than the source file of inspected
  * symbol. If macro is invoked in the same file, source position is always available.
