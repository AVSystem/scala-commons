# REST framework

The commons library contains an RPC based REST framework for defining REST services using Scala traits.
It may be used for implementing both client and server side and works in both JVM and JS, as long as
appropriate network layer is implemented. For JVM, Jetty-based implementations for client and server
are provided.

The core of REST framework is platform independent and network-implementation indepenedent and therefore
has no external dependencies. Because of that, it's a part of `commons-core` module. This is enough to
be able to define REST interfaces. But if you want to expose your REST interface through an actual HTTP
server or have an actual HTTP client for that interface, you need separate implementations for that.
The `commons-jetty` module provides Jetty-based implementations for JVM.

## Quickstart example

First, make sure appropriate dependencies are configured for your project (assuming SBT):

```scala
val commonsVersion: String = ??? // appropriate version of scala-commons here
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.avsystem.commons" %% "commons-core" % commonsVersion,
  "com.avsystem.commons" %% "commons-jetty" % commonsVersion
)
```

Then, define some trivial REST interface:

```scala
import com.avsystem.commons.rest._

case class User(id: String, name: String, birthYear: Int)
object User extends RestDataCompanion[User]

trait UserApi {
  /** Returns newly created user */
  def createUser(name: String, birthYear: Int): Future[User]
}
object UserApi extends DefaultRestApiCompanion[UserApi]
```

Then, implement it on server side and expose it on localhost port 9090 using Jetty:

```scala
import com.avsystem.commons.jetty.rest.RestHandler
import org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server

class UserApiImpl extends UserApi {
  def createUser(name: String, birthYear: Int): Future[User] =
    Future.successful(User(s"$name-ID", name, birthYear))
}

object ServerMain {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val server = new Server(9090)
    server.setHandler(RestHandler[UserApi](new UserApiImpl))
    server.start()
    server.join()
  }
}

```

Finally, obtain a client proxy for your API using Jetty HTTP client and make a call:

```scala
import com.avsystem.commons.jetty.rest.RestClient
import org.eclipse.jetty.client.HttpClient

import scala.concurrent.Await
import scala.concurrent.duration._

object ClientMain {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val client = new HttpClient
    client.start()

    // macro generated proxy implementation of UserApi
    val proxy: UserApi = RestClient[UserApi](client, "http://localhost:9090/")

    // just for this example, normally it's not recommended
    import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

    val result = proxy.createUser("Fred", 1990)
      .andThen({ case _ => client.stop() })
      .andThen {
        case Success(user) => println(s"User ${user.id} created")
        case Failure(cause) => cause.printStackTrace()
      }

    // just wait until future is complete so that main thread doesn't finish prematurely
    Await.result(result, 10.seconds)
  }
}
```

If we look at HTTP traffic, that's what we'll see:

Request:
```
POST http://localhost:9090/createUser HTTP/1.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip
User-Agent: Jetty/9.3.23.v20180228
Host: localhost:9090
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 32

{"name":"Fred","birthYear":1990}
```

Response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 18 Jul 2018 11:43:08 GMT
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 47
Server: Jetty(9.3.23.v20180228)

{"id":"Fred-ID","name":"Fred","birthYear":1990}
```

## Annotations

REST framework relies heavily on annotations for customization. All annotations are governed by
the same [annotation processing](Annotations.md) rules. To use annotations more effectively and with less
boilerplate, it is highly recommended to be familiar with these rules.

## REST API traits

As we saw in the quickstart example, REST API is defined by a Scala trait adjusted with annotations.
This approach is analogous to various well-established REST frameworks for other languages, e.g. JAX-RS for Java.
However, such frameworks are usually based on runtime reflection while in Scala it can be
done using compile-time reflection through macros which offers several advantages:

* platform independence - REST traits are understood by both ScalaJVM and ScalaJS
* full type information - compile-time reflection is not limited by type erasure
* type safety - compile-time reflection can perform thorough validation of REST traits and
  raise compilation errors in case anything is wrong
* pluggable typeclass based serialization - for serialization of REST parameters and results,
  typeclasses are used which also offers strong compile-time safety. If any of your parameters or
  method results cannot be serialized, a detailed compilation error will be raised.

### Companion objects

In order for a trait to be understood as REST API, it must have a well defined companion object that contains
appropriate implicits:

* in order to expose REST API on a server, implicit instances of `RawRest.AsRawRpc` and `RestMetadata` for API trait are required.
* in order to use REST API client, implicit instances of `RawRest.AsRealRpc` and `RestMetadata` for API trait are required.
* when API trait is used by both client and server, `RawRest.AsRawRpc` and `RawRest.AsRealRpc` may be provided by a single
  combined instance of `RawRest.AsRawRealRpc` for API trait.
* additionally, if you want to [generate OpenAPI documents](#generating-openapi-30-specifications) then you need an instance of `OpenApiMetadata`

Usually there is no need to declare these implicit instances manually because you can use one of the convenience
base classes for REST API companion objects, e.g.

```scala
import com.avsystem.commons.rest._

trait MyApi { ... }
object MyApi extends DefaultRestApiCompanion[MyApi]
```

`DefaultRestApiCompanion` takes a magic implicit parameter generated by a macro which will effectively
materialize all the necessary typeclass instances mentioned earlier. The "`Default`" in its name means that
`DefaultRestImplicits` is used as a provider of serialization-related implicits. This effectively plugs 
[`GenCodec`](GenCodec.md) as the default serialization library. See [serialization](#serialization) for more details on 
customizing serialization.

`DefaultRestApiCompanion` provides all the implicit instances necessary for both the client and server.
If you intend to use your API trait only on the server or only on the client, you may want to use more lightweight
`DefaultRestClientApiCompanion` or `DefaultRestServerApiCompanion`. This may help you reduce the amount of macro
generated code and make compilation faster.

#### Manual declaration of implicits

On less frequent occasions you might be unable to use one of the companion base classes. In such situations you must
declare all the implicit instances manually (however, they will still be implemented with a macro).
For example:

```scala
import com.avsystem.commons.rest._

trait GenericApi[T] {
  def process(value: T): Future[T]
}
object GenericApi {
  import DefaultRestImplicits._
  implicit def restAsRawReal[T: GenCodec]: RawRest.AsRawRealRpc[GenericApi[T]] = RawRest.materializeAsRawReal
  implicit def restMetadata[T]: RestMetadata[GenericApi[T]] = RestMetadata.materialize

  import openapi._
  implicit def openApiMetadata[T: RestSchema]: OpenApiMetadata[GenericApi[T]] = OpenApiMetadata.materialize
}
```

This is usually necessary when the API trait is generic, like in the example above.

### HTTP REST methods

REST macro engine inspects an API trait and looks for all abstract methods. It then tries to translate every abstract
method into a HTTP REST call.

* By default (if not annotated explicitly) each method is interpreted as HTTP `POST`.
* Method name is appended to the URL path.
* Every parameter is interpreted as part of the body - by default all the body parameters will be
  combined into a JSON object sent through HTTP body. If method is annotated as [`@FormBody`](#formbody),
  body parameters will be serialized like query parameters, URL-encoded and combined into an
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` form body. However, for `GET` methods, every parameter is
  interpreted as URL query parameter while the body is empty.
* Result type of each method is typically expected to be a `Future` wrapping some
  arbitrary response type. This response type will be serialized into HTTP response which
  by default translates it into JSON and creates a `200 OK` response with `application/json`
  content type. If response type is `Unit` (method result type is `Future[Unit]`) then a `204 No Content`
  response with empty body is created when serializing and body is ignored when deseriarlizing.
* Each method may also throw a `HttpErrorException` (or return failed `Future`). It will be
  automatically translated into appropriate HTTP error response with given status code and
  plaintext message.

For details on how exactly serialization works and how to customize it, see [serialization](#serialization).
Note that if you don't want to use `Future`, this customization also allows you to use other wrappers for method result types.

### Choosing HTTP method

As mentioned earlier, each trait method is by default translated into a `POST` request.
You can specify which HTTP method you want by explicitly annotating trait method as
`@GET`/`@POST`/`@PATCH`/`@PUT` or `@DELETE` (from `com.avsystem.commons.rest` package).

```scala
@DELETE def deleteUser(id: String): Future[Unit]
```

Currently it is not possible define methods to handle `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE` and `CONNECT`
HTTP methods. However, `HEAD` and `OPTIONS` are handled automatically. `HEAD` requests are
handled in exactly the same way as `GET` requests except the body is ultimately stripped from
the response. `OPTIONS` is handled by returning a `200 OK` empty response with an
`Allow` header containing the list of allowed HTTP methods on given path. For example, if you
have `@GET` and `@POST` annotated methods in your REST API trait for some path, `OPTIONS` request
for this path will return `GET,HEAD,POST,OPTIONS`.

#### `GET` methods

Trait method annotated as `@GET` is interpreted somewhat differently from other HTTP methods.
Its parameters are interpreted as _query_ parameters rather than _body_ parameters. For example:

```scala
@GET def getUsername(id: String): Future[String]
```

Calling `getUsername("ID")` on the client will result in HTTP request:

```
GET http://localhost:9090/getUsername?userId=ID HTTP/1.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip
User-Agent: Jetty/9.3.23.v20180228
Host: localhost:9090

```

`@GET` annotated methods are also invoked to handle `HEAD` HTTP requests.
However, response to such request will have its body ultimately stripped.

### Customizing paths

By default, method name is appended to URL path when translating method call to HTTP request.
This can be customized. Every annotation specifying HTTP method (e.g. `GET`) takes an optional
`path` argument that you can use to customize your path:

```scala
@GET("username") def getUsername(id: String): Future[String]
```

The specified path may be multipart (it may contain slashes) or it may even be empty.
However, for server-side APIs all paths must be unambiguous, i.e. there must not be more
than one method translating to the same path. This is validated in runtime, upon
creating a server.

Empty paths may be especially useful for [prefix methods](#prefix-methods).

### Path parameters

If a parameter of REST API trait method is annotated as `@Path`, its value is
appended to URL path rather than translated into query parameter or body part.

```scala
@GET("username") def getUsername(@Path id: String): Future[String]
```

Calling `getUsername("ID")` will make a HTTP request on path `username/ID`.

If there are multiple `@Path` parameters, their values are appended to the path in the
order of declaration. Each path parameters may also optionally specify a _path suffix_ that
will be appended to path after value of each parameter:

```scala
@GET("users") def getUsername(@Path(pathSuffix = "name") id: String): Future[String]
```

Calling `getUsername("ID")` will make a HTTP request on path `users/ID/name`.

This way you can model completely arbitrary path patterns.

Values of path parameters are serialized into `PathValue` objects,
see [serialization](#path-query-and-header-serialization) for more details.

### Query parameters

You may explicitly request that some parameter is translated into URL query parameter
using `@Query` annotation. As mentioned earlier, parameters of `GET` methods are treated
as query parameters by default, so this is only strictly necessary for non-`GET` methods.

`@Query` annotation also takes optional `name` parameter which may be specified to customize
URL parameter name. If not specified, trait method parameter name is used.

Values of query parameters are serialized into `QueryValue` objects,
see [serialization](#path-query-and-header-serialization) for more details.

### Header parameters

You may also request that some parameter is translated into a HTTP header using `@Header` annotation.
It takes an obligatory `name` argument that specifies HTTP header name.

Values of header parameters are serialized into `HeaderValue` objects,
see [serialization](#path-query-and-header-serialization) for more details.

### Body parameters

As mentioned earlier, every parameter of non-`GET` API trait method is interpreted either as a field
of a JSON object sent as HTTP body or (when method is annotated as [`@FormBody`](#formbody)) as a part of URL-encoded
form sent as HTTP body. Just like for path, query and header parameters, there is a
`@BodyField` annotation which requests this explicitly. However, it only makes sense to use this
annotation when one wants to customize the field name because `GET` methods do not accept body parameters.
A method annotated as `@GET` having a parameter annotated as `@BodyField` will be rejected by REST
macro engine.

Body parameters are serialized into `JsonValue` objects (by default) or `QueryValue` objects
(for [`@FormBody`](#formbody) methods), see
[serialization](#body-parameter-serialization) for more details.

### Single body parameters

Every non-`GET` API method may also take a single parameter annotated as `@Body` in place of multiple
unannotated parameters (implicitly interpreted as `@BodyField`s). This way the value of that parameter
will be serialized straight into HTTP body. This gives you full control over the contents sent in HTTP body
and their format (i.e. it no longer needs to be `application/json`).

```scala
case class User(id: String, login: String)
object User extends RestDataCompanion[User]

@PUT def updateUser(@Body user: User): Future[Unit]
```

Single body parameters are serialized into `HttpBody` objects,
see [serialization](#single-body-serialization) for more details.

### `@FormBody`

Non-`GET` methods may be annotated as `@FormBody`. This changes serialization of body parameters
from JSON to HTTP form, encoded as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. Each body parameter itself
is then serialized into `QueryValue` instead of `JsonValue`.

### Prefix methods

If a method in REST API trait doesn't return `Future[T]` (or other type that
properly translates to asynchronous HTTP response) then it may also be interpreted as _prefix_ method.

Prefix methods are methods that return other REST API traits. They are useful for:

* capturing common path or path/query/header parameters in a single prefix call
* splitting your REST API into multiple traits in order to better organize it

Just like HTTP API methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.), prefix methods have their own
annotation that can be used explicitly when you want your trait method to be treated as
a prefix method. This annotation is `@Prefix` and just like HTTP method annotations, it
takes an optional `path` parameter. If you don't need to specify path explicitly then
annotation is not necessary as long as your method returns a valid REST API trait
(where "valid" is determined by presence of appropriate implicits -
see [companion objects](#companion-objects)).

Prefix methods may take parameters. They are interpreted as path parameters by default,
but they may also be annotated as `@Query` or `@Header`. Prefix methods must not take
body parameters.

Path and parameters collected by a prefix method will be prepended/added
to the HTTP request generated by a HTTP method call on the API trait returned by this
prefix method. This way prefix methods "contribute" to the final HTTP requests.

However, sometimes it may also be useful to create completely "transparent" prefix methods -
prefix methods with empty path and no parameters. This is useful when you want to refactor your
REST API trait by grouping methods into multiple, separate traits without changing the
format of HTTP requests.

Example of prefix method that adds authentication header to the overall API:

```scala
trait UserApi { ... }
object UserApi extends DefaultRestApiCompanion[UserApi]

trait RootApi {
  @Prefix("") def auth(@Header("Authorization") token: String): UserApi
}
object RootApi extends DefaultRestApiCompanion[RootApi]
```

### Default parameter values

`@Query`, `@Header` and `@BodyField` parameters may accept a default value which
is picked up by REST framework macro engine and used as fallback value when actual value
is missing in the HTTP request. This is useful primarily for [API evolution](#api-evolution) -
it lets you add more parameters to your REST methods without breaking backwards compatibility
with clients not aware of these new parameters.

Assuming `GenCodec`-based serialization, default values may also be defined for fields of
case classes used as parameter or result types of REST methods.

There are two ways to define default values:

* Scala-level default value
  You can simply use [Scala default parameter value](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/default-parameter-values.html)
  for your REST method parameters and case class parameters. They will be picked up during macro materialization and
  used as fallback values for missing parameters during deserialization. However, Scala-level default values cannot
  be picked up and included into [OpenAPI documents](#generating-openapi-30-specifications).
  Therefore, it's recommended to define default values using `@whenAbsent` annotation

* Using `@whenAbsent` annotation
  Instead of defining Scala-level default value, you can use `@whenAbsent` annotation:
  ```scala
  case class Person(id: String, @whenAbsent("anon") name: String)
  object Person extends RestDataCompanion[Person]
  ```
  This brings two advantages:
  * The default value is for deserialization _only_ and does not affect programmer API,
    which is often the intention of introducing it.
  * Value from `@whenAbsent` annotation can be picked up by macro materialization of
    [OpenAPI documents](#generating-openapi-30-specifications) and included as default value in OpenAPI
    [Schema Objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#schemaObject)

The two approaches can be mixed - you can define Scala-level default value and `@whenAbsent` annotation
at the same time. During deserialization, value from `@whenAbsent` annotation takes priority over Scala-level
default value. This way you can have different fallback value for deserialization and different one
for Scala programming API. And if you want these values to be the same, there's also a handy `whenAbsent.value`
macro which you can use to avoid writing the same default value twice:

```scala
case class Person(id: String, @whenAbsent("anon") name: String = whenAbsent.value)
object Person extends RestDataCompanion[Person]
```

#### `@transientDefault`

If your REST method parameter or case class parameter has a default value defined, you can
also annotate it as `@transientDefault`. This way these parameters will not be serialized at all
if their value is equal to the default value. During deserialization, of course, the default value
will be picked up for them. This way you can reduce the amount of network traffic by sending only
actually meaningful parameters.

## Serialization

REST macro engine must be able to generate code that serializes and deserializes
every parameter value and every method result into appropriate raw values which can
be easily sent through network. Serialization in REST framework is typeclass based,
which is a typical, functional and typesafe approach to serialization in Scala.

Examples of typeclass based serialization libraries include [GenCodec](GenCodec.md)
(which is the default serialization used by this REST framework), [circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/)
(one of the most popular JSON libraries for Scala) or [µPickle](http://www.lihaoyi.com/upickle/).
Any of these solutions can be plugged into REST framework.

### Real and raw values

Depending on the context where a type is used in a REST API trait, it will be serialized to a different
_raw value_:

* path/query/header parameters are serialized as `PathValue`/`QueryValue`/`HeaderValue`
* body parameters are serialized as `JsonValue` (by default) or `QueryValue` (for [`@FormBody`](#formbody) methods)
* Single body parameters are serialized as `HttpBody`
* Response types are serialized as `RestResponse`
* Prefix result types (other REST API traits) are "serialized" as `RawRest`

When a macro needs to serialize a value of some type (let's call it `Real`) to one of these raw types
listed above (let's call it `Raw`) then it looks for an implicit instance of `AsRaw[Raw, Real]`.
In the same manner, an implicit instance of `AsReal[Raw, Real]` is used for deserialization.
Additionally, if there is an implicit instance of `AsRawReal[Raw, Real]` then it serves both purposes.

These implicit instances may come from multiple sources:

* implicit scope of the `Raw` type (e.g. its companion object)
* implicit scope of the `Real` type (e.g. its companion object)
* implicits plugged by REST API trait companion
  (e.g. `DefaultRestApiCompanion` plugs in `DefaultRestImplicits`)
* imports

Of course, these implicits may also depend on other implicits which effectively means that
you can use whatever typeclass-based serialization library you want.
For example, you can define an instance of `AsRaw[JsonValue, Real]` which actually uses
`Encoder[Real]` from [circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/). See [Customizing serialization](#customizing-serialization)
for more details.

### Path, query and header serialization

Path, query and header parameter values are serialized into `PathValue`/`QueryValue`/`HeaderValue`.
These three classes are all simple `String` wrappers. Thanks to the fact that they are distinct types,
you can have completely different serialization defined for each one of them if you need.

There are no "global" implicits defined for these raw types. They must be either imported, defined by each
"real" type or plugged in by REST API trait companion. For example, the `DefaultRestApiCompanion` and its
variations automatically provide serialization to `PathValue`/`QueryValue`/`HeaderValue` based on `GenKeyCodec`
and additional instances for `Float` and `Double`. This effectively provides serialization for all the
primitive types, its Java boxed counterparts, `String`, all `NamedEnum`s, Java enums and `Timestamp`.
It's also easy to provide path/query/header serialization for any type which has a natural, unambiguous textual
representation.

Serialized values of path & query parameters are automatically URL-encoded when being embedded into
HTTP requests. This means that serialization should not worry about that.

### Body parameter serialization

Body parameters are by default serialized into `JsonValue` which is also a simple wrapper class over `String`,
but is importantly distinct from `PathValue`/`QueryValue`/`HeaderValue` because it must always contain
a valid JSON string. This is required because JSON body parameters are ultimately composed into a single
JSON object sent as HTTP body. If a method is annotated as [`@FormBody`](#formbody), body parameters are serialized into
`QueryValue` and combined into an URL-encoded form.

There are no "global" implicits defined for `JsonValue` - JSON serialization must be either imported,
defined by each "real" type manually or plugged in by REST API trait companion. For example,
`DefaultRestApiCompanion` and its variations automatically provide serialization to `JsonValue` based
on `GenCodec`, which means that if `DefaultRestApiCompanion` is used then every type used in REST API trait
that has a `GenCodec` instance will be serializable to `JsonValue`.

### Single body serialization

Single body parameters (annotated as `@Body`) are serialized straight into `HttpBody`, which encapsulates
not only raw content but also MIME type. This way you can define custom body serializations for your types and
you are not limited to `application/json`.

By default (if there are no more specific implicit instances defined),
serialization to `HttpBody` falls back to `JsonValue` and simply wraps JSON string into HTTP body
with `application/json` type. This means that all types serializable to `JsonValue` are automatically
serializable to `HttpBody`.

### Result serialization

Result type of every REST API method is wrapped into `Try` (in case the method throws an exception)
and "serialized" into `RawRest.Async[RestResponse]`.
This means that macro engine looks for an implicit instance of `AsRaw/AsReal[RawRest.Async[RestResponse], Try[R]]`
for every HTTP method with result type `R`.

`RestResponse` itself is a simple class that aggregates HTTP status code and body.

`RestResponse` companion object defines default implicit instances of `AsRaw/Real[RawRest.Async[RestResponse], Try[Future[R]]]`
which depends on implicit `AsRaw/Real[RestResponse, R]`. This effectively means that if your method returns `Future[R]` then
it's enough if `R` is serializable as `RestResponse`.

However, there are even more defaults provided: if `R` is serializable as `HttpBody` then it's automatically serializable
as `RestResponse`. This default translation of `HttpBody` into `RestResponse` always uses 200 as a status code
(or 204 for empty body). When translating `RestResponse` into `HttpBody` and response contains erroneous status code,
`HttpErrorException` is thrown (which will be subsequently captured into failed `Future`).

Going even further with defaults, all types serializable as `JsonValue` are serializable as `HttpBody`.
This effectively means that when your method returns `Future[R]` then you can provide serialization
of `R` into any of the following: `JsonValue`, `HttpBody`, `RestResponse` - depending on how much control
you need.

Ultimately, if you don't want to use `Future`s, you may replace it with some other asynchronous wrapper type,
e.g. Monix Task or some IO monad.
See [supporting result containers other than `Future`](#supporting-result-containers-other-than-future).

### Customizing serialization

#### Introduction

When Scala compiler needs to find an implicit, it searches two scopes: _lexical_ scope and _implicit_ scope.

_Lexical scope_ is made of locally visible and imported implicits. It has priority over implicit scope -
implicit scope is searched only when implicit could not be found in lexical scope.

_Implicit scope_ is made of companion objects of all traits and classes _associated_ with the
type of implicit being searched for. Consult
[Scala Language Specification](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.12/07-implicits.html)
for precise definition of the word "_associated_". As an example, implicit scope of type `AsRaw[JsonValue,MyClass]` is
made of companion objects of `AsRaw`, `JsonValue`, `MyClass` + companion objects of all supertraits, superclasses and
enclosing traits/classes of `MyClass`.

Implicits defined in _implicit scope_ are effectively global and don't need to be imported.

#### Plugging in entirely custom serialization

REST framework deliberately provides **no** default implicits for serialization and deserialization.
Instead, it introduces a mechanism through which serialization implicits are injected by
[companion objects](#companion-objects) of REST API traits. Thanks to this mechanism REST framework is
not bound to any specific serialization library. At the same time it provides a concise method to inject
serialization implicits that does not require importing them explicitly.

An example usage of this mechanism is `DefaultRestApiCompanion` which injects [`GenCodec`](GenCodec.md)-based
serialization.

Let's say you want to use e.g. [circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/) for serialization to `JsonValue`.

First, define a trait that contains implicits which translate Circe's `Encoder` and `Decoder` into
appropriate instances of `AsReal`/`AsRaw`:

```scala
import com.avsystem.commons.rest._
import com.avsystem.commons.rpc._
import io.circe._
import io.circe.parser._
import io.circe.syntax._

trait CirceRestImplicits {
  implicit def encoderBasedAsRawJson[T: Encoder]: Fallback[AsRaw[JsonValue, T]] =
    Fallback(AsRaw.create(v => JsonValue(v.asJson.noSpaces)))
  implicit def decoderBasedJsonAsReal[T: Decoder]: Fallback[AsReal[JsonValue, T]] =
    Fallback(AsReal.create(json => decode(json.value).fold(throw _, identity)))
}
object CirceRestImplicits extends CirceRestImplicits
```

Note that implicits are wrapped into `Fallback`. This is not strictly required, but it's recommended
because these implicits ultimately will have to be imported into lexical scope, even if a macro does it
for us. However, we don't want these implicits to have higher priority than implicits from companion objects
of some concrete classes which need custom serialization. Because of that, we wrap our implicits into
`Fallback` which keeps them visible but without elevated priority.

Now, in order to define a REST API trait that uses Circe-based serialization, you must appropriately
inject it into its companion object:

```scala
trait MyRestApi { ... }
object MyRestApi extends RestApiCompanion[CirceRestImplicits, MyRestApi](CirceRestImplicits)
```

If you happen to use this often (e.g. because you always want to use Circe) then it may be useful
to create convenience companion base class just for Circe:

```scala
abstract class CirceRestApiCompanion[Real](
  implicit inst: MacroInstances[CirceRestImplicits, FullInstances[Real]])
) extends RestApiCompanion[CirceRestImplicits, Real](CirceRestImplicits)
```

Now you can define your trait more concisely as:

```scala
trait MyRestApi { ... }
object MyRestApi extends CirceRestApiCompanion[MyRestApi]
```

**WARNING**: if you also generate [OpenAPI documents](#generating-openapi-30-specifications) for your
REST API, then along from custom serialization you must provide customized instances of
[`RestSchema`](#restschema-typeclass) that will adequately describe your new serialization format.

#### Customizing serialization for your own type

If you need to write manual serialization for your own type, the easiest way to do this is to
provide appropriate implicit in its companion object:

```scala
class MyClass { ... }
object MyClass {
  implicit val jsonAsRawReal: AsRawReal[JsonValue, MyClass] = AsRawReal.create(...)
}
```

**WARNING**: Remember that if you generate [OpenAPI documents](#generating-openapi-30-specifications) for your
REST API then you must also provide custom [`RestSchema`](#restschema-typeclass) instance for your type that
will match its serialization format.

#### Providing serialization for third party type

If you need to define serialization implicits for a third party type, you can't do it through
implicit scope because you can't modify its companion object. Instead, you can adjust implicits injected
into REST API trait companion object.

Assume that companion objects of your REST API traits normally extend `DefaultRestApiCompanion`, i.e.
`GenCodec`-based serialization is used. Now, you can extend `DefaultRestImplicits` to add serialization for
third party types:

```scala
trait EnhancedRestImplicits extends DefaultRestImplicits {
  implicit val thirdPartyJsonAsRawReal: AsRawReal[JsonValue, ThirdParty] =
    AsRawReal.create(...)
}
object EnhancedRestImplicits extends EnhancedRestImplicits
```

Then, you need to define your REST API trait as:

```scala
trait MyRestApi { ... }
object MyRestApi extends RestApiCompanion[EnhancedRestImplicits, MyRestApi](EnhancedRestImplicits)
```

**WARNING**: Remember that if you generate [OpenAPI documents](#generating-openapi-30-specifications) for your
REST API then you must also provide custom [`RestSchema`](#restschema-typeclass) instance for your type that
will match its serialization format.

#### Supporting result containers other than `Future`

By default, every HTTP method in REST API trait must return its return wrapped into a `Future`.
However, `Future` is low level and limited in many ways (e.g. there is no way to control when the actual
asynchronous computation starts). It is possible to use other task-like containers, e.g.
[Monix Task](https://monix.io/docs/2x/eval/task.html) or [Cats IO](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/).

In order to do that, you must provide some additional "serialization" implicits which will translate your
wrapped results into `RawRest.Async[RestResponse]`. Just like when
[providing serialization for third party type](#providing-serialization-for-third-party-type),
you should put that implicit into a trait and inject it into REST API trait's companion object.

Also note that the macro engine re-wraps the already wrapped result into `Try` in case some REST API method throws an
exception. Therefore, if you want your methods to return `Task[T]` then you need serialization for `Try[Task[T]]`.

Additionally, you should provide an implicit instance of `HttpResponseType`, similar to the one defined
in `FutureRestImplicits` trait for `Future`s. This drives materialization of `RestMetadata` in a similar way
`AsRaw` and `AsReal` drive materialization of real<->raw interface translation.

Here's an example that shows what exactly must be implemented to add Monix Task support:

```scala
import monix.eval.Task
import com.avsystem.commons.rest._
import com.avsystem.commons.rest.openapi._

trait MonixTaskRestImplicits {
  implicit def taskAsAsync[T](implicit asResp: AsRaw[RestResponse, T]): AsRaw[RawRest.Async[RestResponse], Try[Task[T]]] =
    AsRaw.create(...)
  implicit def asyncAsTask[T](implicit fromResp: AsReal[RestResponse, T]): AsReal[RawRest.Async[RestResponse], Try[Task[T]]] =
    AsReal.create(...)
  implicit def taskResponseType[T]: HttpResponseType[Task[T]] =
    HttpResponseType[Task[T]]()
  
  // only for OpenAPI generation
  implicit def taskResultType[T: RestResponses]: RestResultType[Task[T]] =
    RestResultType[Future[T]](RestResponses[T].responses)
}
object MonixTaskRestImplicits
```

## API evolution

REST framework gives you a certain amount of guarantees about backwards compatibility of your API.
Here's a list of changes that you may safely do to your REST API traits without breaking clients
that still use the old version:

* Adding new REST methods, as long as paths are still the same and unambiguous.
* Renaming REST methods, as long as old `path` is configured for them explicitly (e.g. `@GET("oldname") def newname(...)`)
* Reordering parameters of your REST methods, except for `@Path` parameters which may be freely intermixed
  with other parameters but they must retain the same order relative to each other.
* Splitting parameters into multiple parameter lists or making them `implicit`.
* Renaming `@Path` parameters - their names are not used in REST requests
* Renaming non-`@Path` parameters, as long as the previous name is explicitly configured by
  `@Query`, `@Header` or `@BodyField` annotation.
* Removing non-`@Path` parameters - even if the client sends them, the server will just ignore them.
* Adding new non-`@Path` parameters, as long as default value is provided for them - either as
  Scala-level default parameter value or by using `@whenAbsent` annotation. The server will simply
  use the default value if parameter is missing in incoming HTTP request.
* Changing parameter or result types or their serialization - as long as serialized formats of new and old type
  are compatible. This depends on on the serialization library you're using. If you're using `GenCodec`, consult
  [its documentation on retaining backwards compatibility](GenCodec.md#safely-introducing-changes-to-serialized-classes-retaining-backwards-compatibility).

## Implementing backends

Core REST framework (`commons-core` module only) does not contain any backends, i.e. there is no actual network
client or server implementation. However, it's fairly easy to build them as most of the heavy-lifting related to
REST is already done by the core framework (its macro engine, in particular).

Jetty-based `RestClient` and `RestHandler` are provided by `commons-jetty` module. They may serve as simple
reference backend implementation.

### Handler function

`RawRest` object defines following type aliases:

```scala
type Callback[T] = Try[T] => Unit
type Async[T] = Callback[T] => Unit
type HandleRequest = RestRequest => Async[RestResponse]
```

`RestRequest` is a simple, immutable representation of HTTP request. It contains HTTP method, path, URL
parameters, HTTP header values and a body (`HttpBody`). All data is already in serialized form so it can be
easily sent through network.

`RestResponse` is, similarly, a simple representation of HTTP response. `RestResponse` is made of HTTP status
code and HTTP body (`HttpBody`, which also contains MIME type).

### Implementing a server

An existing implementation of REST API trait can be easily turned into a `HandleRequest` function using `RawRest.asHandleRequest`.

Therefore, the only thing you need to do to expose your REST API trait as an actual web service it to turn
`HandleRequest` function into a server. This is usually just a matter of translating native HTTP request into `RestRequest`,
passing them to `HandleRequest` function and translating resulting `RestResponse` to native HTTP response.

See [`RestServlet`](../commons-jetty/src/main/scala/com/avsystem/commons/jetty/rest/RestServlet.scala)
for an example implementation.

### Implementing a client

If you already have a `HandleRequest` function, you can easily turn it into an implementation of desired REST API trait
using `RawRest.fromHandleRequest`. This implementation is a macro-generated proxy which translates actual
method calls into invocations of provided `HandleRequest` function.

Therefore, the only thing you need to to in order to wrap a native HTTP client into a REST API trait instance is
to turn this native HTTP client into a `HandleRequest` function.

See Jetty-based [`RestClient`](../commons-jetty/src/main/scala/com/avsystem/commons/jetty/rest/RestClient.scala) for
an example implementation.

## Generating OpenAPI 3.0 specifications

[OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md) is an open standard for describing
REST endpoints using JSON or YAML. It can be consumed by e.g. [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) in
order to generate nicely looking, human-readable documentation of a REST endpoint.

REST framework provides automatic generation of OpenAPI documents based on REST API traits.
In order to do this, `OpenApiMetadata` typeclass must be available for an API trait. If your trait's companion
extends `DefaultRestApiCompanion` or `DefaultRestServerApiCompanion` then `OpenApiMetadata` is automatically
materialized by a macro. You can then use it to generate OpenAPI specification document like this:

```scala
import com.avsystem.commons.rest._

trait MyRestApi {
  ...
}
object MyRestApi extends DefaultRestApiCompanion[MyRestApi]

object PrintOpenApiJson {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val openapi = MyRestApi.openapiMetadata.openapi(
      Info("Some REST API", "0.1", description = "Some example REST API"),
      servers = List(Server("http://localhost"))
    )
    println(JsonStringOutput.writePretty(openapi))
  }
}
```

### Operation IDs

For every HTTP REST method, an
[Operation Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#operationObject)
will be generated. `operationId` of that object will be by default set to HTTP method's `rpcName`.
`rpcName` itself defaults to method's regular name if not specified explicitly.

Additionally, if HTTP method is overloaded then all overloaded variants except for the first one will
have `rpcName` prepended with lowercased HTTP method followed by underscore (e.g. `post_`).

Finally, if HTTP method is a member of [prefix method](#prefix-methods)'s result, `operationId` will be further prepended with
the prefix method's `rpcName` followed by underscore.

All this behaviour may be customized with `@operationId` and `@operationIdPrefix` annotations.
It's important for operations to have sensible IDs because tools that generate client code in other programming
languages for REST API defined in OpenAPI documents often reuse operation IDs as method/function names that
map to REST requests.

Note that Operation object itself may be arbitrarily adjusted with other annotations -
see [adjusting operations](#adjusting-operations).

### `RestSchema` typeclass

In order to macro-materialize `OpenApiMetadata` for your REST API, you need to provide an instance of `RestSchema` typeclass
for every type used by your API (as a parameter or result type, i.e. when your method returns `Future[T]` then
`RestSchema[T]` will be needed). `RestSchema` contains a description of data type that is later translated into
[OpenAPI Schema Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#schemaObject).

Most of the primitive types, collection types, `Option`, `Opt`, etc. already have an appropriate `RestSchema` instance defined
(roughly the same set of simple types that have `GenCodec` automatically available). If `RestSchema` is not defined, there are
usually two ways to provide it:

#### Macro materialized ADT schemas

If your data type is an ADT (algebraic data type) - which means case class, object or sealed hierarchy - the easiest way
to provide schema is by making companion object of your data type extend `RestDataCompanion` - this will automatically
materialize a `RestStructure` instance for your data type. `RestSchema` is then built based on that `RestStructure`.
`RestDataCompanion` also automatically materializes a `GenCodec` instance.

```scala
case class User(id: String, @whenAbsent("anon") name: String, birthYear: String)
object User extends RestDataCompanion[User] // gives GenCodec + RestStructure + RestSchema
```

[Schema Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#schemaObject) generated for
`User` class will look like this:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "default": "anon"
    },
    "birthYear": {
      "type": "integer",
      "format": "int32"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "id",
    "birthYear"
  ]
}
```

It's also possible to macro materialize schema without using `RestDataCompanion`:

```scala
object User {
  implicit lazy val schema: RestSchema[User] = RestStructure.materialize[User].standaloneSchema
}
```

Schema derived for an ADT from macro materialized `RestStructure` will describe the JSON format used by
`GenCodec` macro materialized for that type. It will take into account all the annotations, e.g.
`@flatten`, `@name`, `@transparent`, `@whenAbsent` etc.

##### Registered schemas

By default, schemas macro materialized for case classes and sealed hierarchies will be _named_.
This means they will not be inlined but rather registered under their name in
[Components Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#componentsObject).
By default, the name that will be used will be the simple (unqualified) name of the data type, e.g. "User".
When referring to registered schema (e.g. in
[Media Type Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#mediaTypeObject)),
a [Reference Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#referenceObject)
will be inserted, e.g. `{"$ref": "#/components/schemas/User"}`. This is good for schema reuse but may lead to name
conflicts if you have multiple data types with the same name but in different packages. In such situations, you must
disambiguate names of your data types with `@name` annotation. Unfortunately, such conflicts cannot be detected in compile
time and will only be reported in runtime, when trying to generate OpenAPI document.

##### Adjusting macro materialized schemas

It's possible to adjust schemas macro materialized for ADTs using annotations. For example, you can use
`@description` annotation on data types and case class fields to inject description into materialized schemas, e.g.

```scala
import com.avsystem.commons.rest._
import openapi._

@description("data type for users")
case class User(id: String, @description("user name") name: User, birthYear: Int)
object User extends RestDataCompanion[User]
```

You can also use more general `@adjustSchema` annotation which lets you define
completely arbitrary schema transformations.
See [Adjusting generated OpenAPI documents with annotations](#adjusting-generated-openapi-documents-with-annotations)
for more details on this mechanism.

#### Manually defined schemas

You may also define `RestSchema` completely by hand. This is usually done for primitive types or types with custom
serialization, different from macro materialized `GenCodec`. You can also insert references to externally defined
schemas.

```scala
class CustomStringType { ... }
object CustomStringType {
  implicit val restSchema: RestSchema[CustomType] =
    RestSchema.plain(Schema(`type` = DataType.String, description = "custom string type"))
}
```

### `RestResponses` typeclass

`RestResponses` is an auxiliary typeclass which is needed for result type of every HTTP REST method
in your REST API trait. For example, if your method returns `Future[User]` then you need an instance
of `RestResponses[User]` (this transformation is modeled by yet another intermediate typeclass, `RestResultType`).
This typeclass governs generation of
[Responses Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#responsesObject)

By default, if no specific `RestResponses` instance is provided, it is created based on `RestSchema`.
The resulting [Responses](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#responsesObject)
will contain exactly one
[Response](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#responseObject)
for HTTP status code `200 OK` with a single
[Media Type](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#mediaTypeObject)
for `application/json` media type and
[Schema](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#schemaObject)
inferred from `RestSchema` instance.

You may want to define `RestResponses` instance manually if you want to use other media types than
`application/json` or you want to define multiple possible responses for different HTTP status codes.
You may also modify responses for particular method - see [Adjusting operations](#adjusting-operations).
Normally, manual `RestResponses` instance is needed when a type has custom `AsRaw/AsReal[RestResponse, T]`
instance which defines custom serialization to HTTP response.

### `RestRequestBody` typeclass

`RestRequestBody` typeclass is an auxiliary typeclass analogous to `RestResponses`. It's necessary
for `@Body` parameters of REST methods and governs generation of
[Request Body Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#requestBodyObject).
By default, if not defined explicitly, it's also derived from `RestSchema` and contains single
[Media Type](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#mediaTypeObject)
for `application/json` media type and
[Schema](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#schemaObject)
inferred from `RestSchema` instance.

You may want to provide custom instance of `RestRequestBody` for your type if that type is serialized
to different media type than `application/json` (which can be done by providing appropriate instance
of `AsReal/AsRaw[HttpBody, T]`.

### Adjusting generated OpenAPI documents with annotations

The way OpenAPI documents are generated for your REST API can be influenced with annotations
applied on REST methods, parameters and data types. The most common example is the `@description` annotation
which may be applied on data types, case class fields, REST methods and parameters.
It causes the description to be injected into appropriate
[Schema](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#schemaObject),
[Parameter](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#parameterObject) or
[Operation](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#operationObject)
objects.

However, `@description` is just an example of more general mechanism - schemas, parameters and operations
can be modified arbitrarily.

Also, remember that all annotations are processed with respect to the same
[annotation processing](Annotations.md) rules. It is recommended to familiarize oneself with these rules in
order to use them more effectively and with less boilerplate.

List of predefined adjuster annotations can be found in
[API reference](http://avsystem.github.io/scala-commons/api/com/avsystem/commons/rest/openapi/adjusters/index.html)

#### Adjusting schemas

In order to adjust schemas, one can define arbitrary annotations that extend `SchemaAdjuster`.
There is also a default implementation of `SchemaAdjuster`, the `@adjustSchema` annotation which
takes a lambda parameter which defines the schema transformation.

Annotations extending `SchemaAdjuster` can arbitrarily transform a
[Schema Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#schemaObject)
and can be applied on:

* data types with macro-generated `RestSchema`
* case class fields of data types with macro generated `RestSchema`
* `@BodyField` and `@Body` parameters of REST methods

Schema adjusters do **NOT** work on path/header/query parameters and REST methods
themselves. Instead use [parameter adjusters](#adjusting-parameters) and
[operation adjusters](#adjusting-operations) which can also modify schemas
used by `Parameter` and `Operation` objects.

Also, be aware that a `SchemaAdjuster` may be passed a schema reference instead of actual schema object.
This reference is then wrapped into a
[Schema Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#schemaObject)
object defined as `{"allOf": [{"$ref": <the-original-reference>}]}`.
Therefore, a schema adjuster may extend the referenced schema using
[Composition and Inheritance](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#schemaComposition)
but it should not rely on the ability to inspect the referenced schema.

#### Adjusting parameters

Similar to `SchemaAdjuster` there is a `ParameterAdjuster` annotation trait. Its default implementation
is `@adjustParameter` which takes transformation lambda as its parameter.
Schema adjusters can arbitrarily transform
[Parameter Objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#parameterObject)
which are generated for path, header and query parameters of REST methods.

#### Adjusting operations

For adjusting [Operation Objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#operationObject)
there is `OperationAdjuster` annotation trait with default implementation `@adjustOperation`.
Operation adjuster can be applied on REST HTTP methods in order to transform Operation Objects
generated for them. This in particular means that operation adjusters can modify request body and responses
of an operation. When operation adjuster is applied on a [prefix method](#prefix-methods), it will apply to all
operations associated with result of this prefix method.

#### Adjusting path items

For adjusting [Path Item Objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#pathItemObject)
there is `PathItemAdjuster` annotation trait with default implementagion `@adjustPathItem`.
Path item adjuster can be applied on REST HTTP methods in order to transform Path Item objects generated for them.
Because multiple REST HTTP methods may have the same path, adjusters are collected from all methods and ultimately all
are applied on the associated Path Item Object. When path item adjuster is applied on a [prefix method](#prefix-methods),
it will apply to all Path Item Objects associated with result of this prefix method.

### Limitations

* Scala-level default values of method parameters are not included in the OpenAPI Schema objects.
  You need to use `@whenAbsent` annotation instead.
* Current representation of OpenAPI document does not support
[specification extensions](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#specificationExtensions).
